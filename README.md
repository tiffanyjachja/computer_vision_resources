## Setup

If you would like to use a virtual environment with preinstalled libraries. Setup the conda environment by using the [environment.yml](/environment.yml) file.

To do so:
1. Use the terminal command:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. Activate the new environment:
`conda activate cv_env`
3. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
`conda env list`
